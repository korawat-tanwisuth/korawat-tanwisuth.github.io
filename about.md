### My background
My name is Korawat, but I go by "K" for short". I am originally from Bangkok, Thailand. Currently, I am a third year Ph.D. student in statistics at the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to this degree, I completed a master degree in analytics at the same university and an undergraduate degree in supply chain management with a minor in statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In my free time, I enjoy working out.

I have experience in open-ended research and applied machine learning projects. I interned at Hypergiant as a data scientist and at Amazon as an applied scientist.
