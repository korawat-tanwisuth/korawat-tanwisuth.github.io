# Current project
- Asymptotic conditional transport with cycle consistency

In this project, we propose a new divergence measure, termed asymptotic conditional transport, to match the marginal distributions of images from two domains. The example below shows an application of our algorithm. We can convert satellite images to their Google map counterparts. Our divergence measure consistently outperforms traditional image translation algorithms in terms of generating high-quality and realistic images.
